# TDD-[KPG-2373] Enhance Visual & Sound Notifications for Digital Conversations

## Motivation & Context

When the agent uses Digital Conversations, agent can listen to Sound Notifications according to the set speaker device.

When the agent uses other products and there are new offer conversation or new messages from contact person, the badge will be used to remind the agent.

## Product badge notifications

Atlas service enables apps to display and hide badges on top of its respective icons for a given user.

add badge to command processor

```js
const offer_digital_connect_conversation = () => {
  return {
    command: 'render_conversation',
    template: 'text_interaction',
    //...
+    badge: true
  }
}
```

it will display a badge on Workspace dock signaling that the agent is in a conversation phase

## Set up speaker devices

Atlas service provides methods to retrieve information about connected audio devices and set each type's selected device.

To use this service the app must have the @atlas/audio-device-management capability:

```json
{
...
"capabilities": ["@atlas/audio-device-management"]
}
```

Implement the getSelectedAudioDevices method to obtain the selected audio device

```js
export async function getSelectedAudioDevices() {
  const selectedDevices =
    await atlasSDK.audioDeviceManagement.getSelectedDevices();

  const allDevices = await navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices();

  return allDevices.find(
    (device) =>
      device.kind === "audiooutput" &&
      device.label === selectedDevices.ringtone_output.label
  );
}
```

Add device id to AudioBlock input

```js
export function buildOfferAudioBlock() {
  return {
    type: AUDIO_BLOCK_NAME,
    input: {
      src: "",
      get: async () => {
        const { inbound_conversation_offered } = await provider.get();

        const selectedDevice = await getSelectedAudioDevices();

        reportToPendo(inbound_conversation_offered);

        return { ...inbound_conversation_offered, device_id: selectedDevice };
      },
    },
  };
}
```
